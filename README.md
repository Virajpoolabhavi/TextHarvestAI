> Web Scraping and Text Extraction:
    Text Harvesh AI uses web scraping to fetch and extract text content from provided URLs. It efficiently processes the web page to retrieve the relevant text, which is     then saved as a text file. This allows users to analyze the content of web pages without manually copying and pasting the text.
> Integration with Gemini AI for Analysis:
  Once the text file is generated from the web scraping process, Text Harvesh AI uploads the file to a Large Language Model (LLM) powered by Gemini AI. The LLM             analyzes the text, providing insights, summaries, and answers to user queries based on the content. This integration enables advanced and context-aware analysis of       web-based  information.
> PDF Upload and Query Functionality:
  Text Harvesh AI supports uploading PDF documents for analysis. Users can upload their PDF files, and the software processes these documents to extract the text. The
  extracted text is then analyzed by Gemini AI, allowing users to ask specific questions about the content and receive accurate, detailed responses.
> User-Friendly Query System:
  The platform offers an intuitive interface for users to interact with the analyzed text. Whether it's content from a web page or an uploaded PDF, users can input        queries related to the text, and the system provides the best possible answers based on the analysis performed by Gemini AI. This feature makes it a powerful tool for   research, content analysis, and information retrieval.
